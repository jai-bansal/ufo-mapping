#### Synopsis:
This project maps UFO sightings using publicly available data.

#### Motivation:
This project exists to document some experimentation with web scraping and using the ggmap mapping interface.

#### Dataset Details:
The UFO sightings are from "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reported_UFO_sightings". I only include sightings in the contiguous United States from the 20th and 21st centuries. I also remove a few data points which don't play well with the mapping process. 

#### Running Scripts:
The included R script can be run out of the box and outputs a map graphic. Next on the to-do list is a Shiny app.

After running the script, the value of your portfolio (before adding funds) is stored in 'current_value'. The shares you need to buy (depending on your target allocation and funds you are adding) are in 'portfolio$shares_to_buy'. Finally, money that will be leftover (since only integer numbers of shares can be purchased) is stored in 'leftover'.
